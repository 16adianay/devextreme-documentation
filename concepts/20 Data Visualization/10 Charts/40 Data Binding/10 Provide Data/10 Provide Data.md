You can use one of the two approaches to provide data for **Chart**, **PieChart** or **Sparkline**. The first is declaring an array of plain objects and using it as a data source. For more information on this approach, see the [Using an Array of Objects](/concepts/20%20Data%20Visualization/10%20Charts/40%20Data%20Binding/10%20Provide%20Data/20%20Using%20an%20Array%20of%20Objects.md '/Documentation/Guide/Data_Visualization/Charts/Data_Binding/#Provide_Data/Using_an_Array_of_Objects') topic. The second is implementing a data source using the [data library](/concepts/30%20Data%20Layer/5%20Data%20Layer '/Documentation/Guide/Data_Layer/Data_Layer/'). With its new level of sophistication, this approach brings you the privileges and flexibility not before seen in primitive arrays. This approach is discussed in greater detail in the [Using the Data Library](/concepts/20%20Data%20Visualization/10%20Charts/40%20Data%20Binding/10%20Provide%20Data/30%20Using%20the%20Data%20Library/10%20Using%20the%20Data%20Library.md '/Documentation/Guide/Data_Visualization/Charts/Data_Binding/#Provide_Data/Using_the_Data_Library') topic.
