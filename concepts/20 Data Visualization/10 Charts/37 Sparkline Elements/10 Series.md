A series is a group of related data points. The most important characteristic of a series is its type, which determines a specific visual presentation of data. In this topic, you will learn how to set a series type and configure series settings.

To set the series type that best suits your needs, specify the [type](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/60%20dxSparkline/1%20Configuration/type.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxSparkline/Configuration/#type') option of the main configuration object. By default, the [line](/concepts/20%20Data%20Visualization/10%20Charts/38%20Sparkline%20Series%20Types/010%20Line.md '/Documentation/Guide/Data_Visualization/Charts/Sparkline_Series_Types/#Line') series type is set.

	<!--JavaScript-->var sparklineOptions = {
		type: 'line',
		// ...
	};

Since sparklines are simple in nature, sparkline series offer few configuration options. The majority of series types, except [bar](/concepts/20%20Data%20Visualization/10%20Charts/38%20Sparkline%20Series%20Types/070%20Bar.md '/Documentation/Guide/Data_Visualization/Charts/Sparkline_Series_Types/#Bar') and [win-loss](/concepts/20%20Data%20Visualization/10%20Charts/38%20Sparkline%20Series%20Types/080%20Win-Loss.md '/Documentation/Guide/Data_Visualization/Charts/Sparkline_Series_Types/#Win-Loss'), have the [lineColor](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/60%20dxSparkline/1%20Configuration/lineColor.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxSparkline/Configuration/#lineColor') and [lineWidth](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/60%20dxSparkline/1%20Configuration/lineWidth.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxSparkline/Configuration/#lineWidth') options to customize series' appearance. In turn, *bar* series have the [barPositiveColor](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/60%20dxSparkline/1%20Configuration/barPositiveColor.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxSparkline/Configuration/#barPositiveColor') and [barNegativeColor](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/60%20dxSparkline/1%20Configuration/barNegativeColor.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxSparkline/Configuration/#barNegativeColor') options, and *win-loss* series have [winColor](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/60%20dxSparkline/1%20Configuration/winColor.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxSparkline/Configuration/#winColor') and [lossColor](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/60%20dxSparkline/1%20Configuration/lossColor.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxSparkline/Configuration/#lossColor') options for the same purpose.

Series are constructed on the base of data that can be provided using many different approaches. To review them all, refer to the [Data Binding](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Visualization/Charts/Data_Binding/#Data_Binding) guide.
