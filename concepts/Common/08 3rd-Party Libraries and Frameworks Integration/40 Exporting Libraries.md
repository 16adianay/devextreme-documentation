The DevExtreme [DataGrid](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/') widget supports client-side data export - see [Client-Side Export](/concepts/05%20Widgets/DataGrid/090%20Client-Side%20Export '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Client-Side_Export/'). To accomplish this, a reference to the JSZip library is required. This library can be found in the DevExtreme zip archive or in the folder where you have installed DevExtreme, which is **C:\Program Files (x86)\DevExpress 16.2\DevExtreme\Sources** by default.
