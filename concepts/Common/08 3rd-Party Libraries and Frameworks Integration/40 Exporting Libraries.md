The DevExtreme [DataGrid](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/') widget supports client-side data export - see [Client-Side Export](/concepts/10%20UI%20Widgets/70%20Data%20Grid/090%20Client-Side%20Export '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Data_Grid/Client-Side_Export/'). To accomplish this, a reference to the *jsZip.js* JavaScript library is required. This library is accessible within your [DevExtreme Package](/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_Packages/#DevExtreme_Packages).
