The [DevExtreme data layer](/concepts/30%20Data%20Layer/5%20Data%20Layer '/Documentation/Guide/Data_Layer/Data_Layer/') includes the Store data access interface, which is supported by all DevExtreme UI widgets working with data, such as the **List**, **Gallery**, **DataGrid** widgets, etc. DevExtreme includes several Store implementations out-of-the-box. To consume OData web services, use the ready-to-use [ODataStore](/concepts/30%20Data%20Layer/51%20Data%20Source%20Examples/2%20OData '/Documentation/Guide/Data_Layer/Data_Source_Examples/#OData').

In addition to the ODataStore, we introduced the [BreezeJS](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme-14.2-DataLayerExtensions/tree/master/breeze) and [JayData](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme-14.2-DataLayerExtensions/tree/master/jayData) extensions, which contain classes accessing data using the [BreezeJS](https://www.getbreezenow.com) and [JayData](https://jaydata.org) libraries respectively.
