Localization adapts your application to linguistic and regional differences. DevExtreme allows you to localize:

- Messages (using [dictionaries](/concepts/Common/33%20Localization/01%20Dictionaries '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Dictionaries'))
- Numbers, dates, and currencies (using [Intl](/concepts/Common/33%20Localization/05%20Localize%20Dates,%20Numbers,%20and%20Currencies/05%20Using%20Intl.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Localize_Dates_Numbers_and_Currencies/Using_Intl') or [Globalize](/concepts/Common/33%20Localization/05%20Localize%20Dates,%20Numbers,%20and%20Currencies/10%20Using%20Globalize.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Localize_Dates_Numbers_and_Currencies/Using_Globalize')).

DevExtreme also supports [right-to-left layout](/concepts/Common/33%20Localization/20%20Right-to-Left%20Support.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Right-to-Left_Support').

[note] Refer to the [Using Intl](/concepts/35%20ASP.NET%20MVC%20Controls/38%20Localization/10%20Using%20Intl/00%20Using%20Intl.md '/Documentation/Guide/ASP.NET_MVC_Controls/Localization/Using_Intl/') and [Using Globalize](/concepts/35%20ASP.NET%20MVC%20Controls/38%20Localization/20%20Using%20Globalize/00%20Using%20Globalize.md '/Documentation/Guide/ASP.NET_MVC_Controls/Localization/Using_Globalize/') articles if you are localizing DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Control.
