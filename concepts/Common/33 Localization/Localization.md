Localization adapts your application to linguistic and regional differences. DevExtreme widgets allow you to localize:

- Messages (using [dictionaries](/concepts/Common/33%20Localization/01%20Dictionaries.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Dictionaries'))
- Numbers, dates, and currencies (using a [localization library](/concepts/Common/33%20Localization/05%20Using%20Localization%20Libraries '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Using_Localization_Libraries'): Intl or Globalize).

Additional functionality includes [value formatting](/concepts/Common/33%20Localization/15%20Value%20Formatting '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Value_Formatting') and [right-to-left layout](/concepts/Common/33%20Localization/20%20Right-to-Left%20Support.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Right-to-Left_Support') support.

[note] If you are localizing DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Controls, see the [Using Intl](/concepts/35%20ASP.NET%20MVC%20Controls/38%20Localization/10%20Using%20Intl/00%20Using%20Intl.md '/Documentation/Guide/ASP.NET_MVC_Controls/Localization/Using_Intl/') and [Using Globalize](/concepts/35%20ASP.NET%20MVC%20Controls/38%20Localization/20%20Using%20Globalize/00%20Using%20Globalize.md '/Documentation/Guide/ASP.NET_MVC_Controls/Localization/Using_Globalize/') articles.
