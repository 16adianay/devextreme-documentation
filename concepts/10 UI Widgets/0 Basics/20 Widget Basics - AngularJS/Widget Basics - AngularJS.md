DevExtreme UI widgets can be used in applications built using the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) version 1.2 and 1.3. 

[note]If you use AngularJS version 1.3, pay attention to the [Migration Guide](https://ng-learn.org/2014/06/Migration_Guide_from_1-2_to1-3).

[note]DevExtreme provides a CTP version of the [Angular 2 integration module](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-angular2). This version is available for your evaluation, yet it has some issues waiting to be addressed. Keep track of them or post a newly-found one on [this GitHub page](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-angular2/issues).
