The DevExtreme Widgets library is extensive and powerful enough for you to build applications based only on the DevExtreme widgets. To start building such applications quickly, DevExtreme supplies different application templates. The [DevExtreme Complete](/concepts/Common/07%20DevExtreme%20Packages/30%20DevExtreme%20Complete.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_Packages/#DevExtreme_Complete') package comes with Visual Studio -integrated [project templates](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/0%20Project%20Templates '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/') that allow you to build both mobile and web applications using either the [DevExtreme SPA Framework](/concepts/Common/05%20Introduction%20to%20DevExtreme/10%20Mobile%20Development/10%20Overview/20%20SPA%20Framework.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Introduction_to_DevExtreme/#Mobile_Development/Overview/SPA_Framework') or the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) framework. To learn more on VS templates as well as on the wizards and designers for Visual Studio, refer to the [VS Integration](/Documentation/Guide/#vsintegration) guides.

To help you build applications in environments alternative to Visual Studio, [DevExtreme Web](/concepts/Common/07%20DevExtreme%20Packages/20%20DevExtreme%20Web.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_Packages/#DevExtreme_Web') and [DevExtreme Mobile](/concepts/Common/07%20DevExtreme%20Packages/10%20DevExtreme%20Mobile.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_Packages/#DevExtreme_Mobile') provide templates for web and mobile applications. Read below for details.
