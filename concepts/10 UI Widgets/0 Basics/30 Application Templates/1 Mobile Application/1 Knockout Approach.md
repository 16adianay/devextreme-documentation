To create mobile applications based on Knockout binding, you will need a framework to manage view navigation and rendering. The [DevExtreme SPA framework](/concepts/Common/05%20Introduction%20to%20DevExtreme/10%20Mobile%20Development/10%20Overview '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Introduction_to_DevExtreme/#Mobile_Development/Overview') solves these tasks. So the **Knockout** application template is based on the DevExtreme SPA framework. You can learn template structure details from the **SPA Framework** | [Application Project](/concepts/40%20SPA%20Framework/01%20Application%20Project '/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Application_Project/') article. To learn how to build applications using the SPA framework, refer to the [Application Design](/concepts/40%20SPA%20Framework/00%20Application%20Development '/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Application_Development/') article. To learn how to create DevExtreme widgets using the Knockout approach, refer to the [Widget Basics - Knockout Approach](/concepts/10%20UI%20Widgets/0%20Basics/25%20Widget%20Basics%20-%20Knockout/01%20Create%20and%20Configure%20a%20Widget.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Basics/Widget_Basics_-_Knockout/#Create_and_Configure_a_Widget') topic.

[note]The **Knockout** application template uses the [NavBar](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxNavBar '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxNavBar/') widget as a global navigation control. You can change it to the [SlideOut](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxSlideOut '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxSlideOut/') widget.
