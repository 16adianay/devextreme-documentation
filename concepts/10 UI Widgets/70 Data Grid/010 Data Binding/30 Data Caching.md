By default, the **DataGrid** caches loaded data. It improves the widget performance by reducing the number of queries to the data source when the end-user sorts, filters or groups data. See the [cacheEnabled](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/cacheEnabled.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#cacheEnabled') option description to learn more about **DataGrid** cashing capabilities.
