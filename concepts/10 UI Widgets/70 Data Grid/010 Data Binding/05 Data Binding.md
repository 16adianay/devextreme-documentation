You can declare an array of plain objects or implement a custom store encapsulating some sophisticated logic - **DataGrid** will operate with any source fast and seamless. In this guide, you will learn the ways of providing and binding data to the **DataGrid** widget.

Before you begin, please make sure you have successfully linked the necessary libraries and added the **DataGrid** widget to your page.
