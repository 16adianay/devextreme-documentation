A single mode is preferable when you only need one grid row to be selected at a time. To select a row in this mode, an end-user must click this row. When a user clicks another row, the formerly selected one becomes unselected.

Additionally, a selected row can be deselected by a mouse click as you press the CTRL key. For information on keyboard shortcuts in **DataGrid**, see the [Keyboard Navigation](/concepts/10%20UI%20Widgets/70%20Data%20Grid/100%20Keyboard%20Support/10%20Keyboard%20Support.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Data_Grid/Keyboard_Support/') and [Selecting Using Keyboard Shortcuts](/concepts/10%20UI%20Widgets/70%20Data%20Grid/017%20Selection/050%20Selecting%20Using%20Keyboard%20Shortcuts.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Data_Grid/Selection/#Selecting_Using_Keyboard_Shortcuts') topics.

The animation below demonstrates how to perform selection in a single mode.
