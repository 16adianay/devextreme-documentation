Selection is a **DataGrid** feature that allows an end-user to mark certain rows in a grid as selected. Selected rows have a differing appearance from regular rows. After a row is selected, its data may be processed the way you require.

[note] Only [data rows](/concepts/10%20UI%20Widgets/70%20Data%20Grid/001%20Visual%20Elements/020%20Grid%20Rows.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Data_Grid/Visual_Elements/#Grid_Rows') can be selected.
