The **agenda** view lists all available appointments grouped by date. This view provides a compact representation of appointments, which is useful when displaying on narrow screens.

The **agenda** view can display appointments for seven dates at a time starting with the date specified using the [currentDate](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxScheduler/1%20Configuration/currentDate.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxScheduler/Configuration/#currentDate') option. The all-day panel is not available in the **agenda** view. If an appointment lasts all day, it is placed above other appointments of that day. 

If you [group](/concepts/10%20UI%20Widgets/72%20Scheduler/40%20Resources/030%20Group%20Appointments%20by%20Resources.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Scheduler/Resources/#Group_Appointments_by_Resources') appointments by resources, the [resource headers](/concepts/10%20UI%20Widgets/72%20Scheduler/10%20Visual%20Elements/040%20Resource%20Headers.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Scheduler/Visual_Elements/#Resource_Headers') are located to the left of the dates.

If an appointment lasts for several days, it is displayed for every date it belongs to. 

The **agenda** view does not support the adding and dragging of appointments.
