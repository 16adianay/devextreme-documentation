The **month** view displays appointments assigned to a month.

Appointments are placed from left to right. The day scale is located at the top of the view. The time scale and all-day panel are not available in this view. The size of an appointment depends on its duration in days. Even if an appointment lasts only for several hours or minutes, it occupies the entire day cell.

By default, a day cell displays two appointments, if there are more, they are shown collapsed.

If collapsed appointments occupy more than 75% of the day cell width, they are displayed as a single appointment collector.

If an appointment collector encloses appointments associated with the same resource, it has the color of the assigned resource. Otherwise the collector is colored in default color.

If appointments are [grouped by resources](/concepts/05%20Widgets/Scheduler/40%20Resources/030%20Group%20Appointments%20by%20Resources.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Scheduler/Resources/#Group_Appointments_by_Resources'), the [resource headers](/concepts/05%20Widgets/Scheduler/10%20Visual%20Elements/040%20Resource%20Headers.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Scheduler/Visual_Elements/#Resource_Headers') are located above the day scale.
