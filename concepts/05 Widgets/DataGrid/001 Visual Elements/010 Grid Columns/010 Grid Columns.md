There are two central elements, which the **DataGrid** widget is built on: grid columns and [grid rows](/concepts/05%20Widgets/DataGrid/001%20Visual%20Elements/020%20Grid%20Rows.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Visual_Elements/#Grid_Rows'). This topic covers the main features of grid columns and the ways they can be configured.

A grid column is a visual representation of a set of data values that have a particular type. The general appearance of grid columns in the **DataGrid** widget is demonstrated in the image below.
