The form editing mode is technically equivalent to the [row mode](/concepts/05%20Widgets/DataGrid/070%20Data%20Editing/20%20Editing%20in%20UI/20%20Row%20Mode.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Data_Editing/#Editing_in_UI/Row_Mode'). The only difference is a visual presentation of a row in the editing state.

When a row is being edited in the form mode, it transforms into a form as shown at the screenshot below.
