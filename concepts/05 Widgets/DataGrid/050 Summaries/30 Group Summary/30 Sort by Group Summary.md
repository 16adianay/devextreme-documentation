When records are grouped by a column, the groups are sorted according to the values of this column by default. To sort groups in a different way according to group summaries, use the grid's [sortByGroupSummaryInfo](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/sortByGroupSummaryInfo '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/sortByGroupSummaryInfo/') option.
