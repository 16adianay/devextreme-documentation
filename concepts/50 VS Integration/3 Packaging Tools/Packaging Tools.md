The last step in producing a mobile application is packaging. The applications created using the [DevExtreme project templates](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/0%20Project%20Templates/02%20DevExtreme%20App%20Project%20Template '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#DevExtreme_App_Project_Template') can be easily packaged to be deployed to any device.

DevExtreme comes with the **Build Native Package** wizard. This wizard helps produce a native package for one of the following platforms.

- **iOS**, **Android** and **WindowsPhone**  
	A native package for these platforms is a PhoneGap container with your DevExtreme application packed as a resource. When building a package, the Package Builder replaces the fake *cordova.js* file located in the application project's root with a valid platform specific Cordova library version 3.7.

- **Any Platform**  
	You can generate a **zip** file that is ready for the [PhoneGap Build server](https://build.phonegap.com).

Below you will learn how to build a package from a [Basic Application](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/0%20Project%20Templates/1%20Basic%20Application.md '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#Basic_Application') project template or the [Mobile](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/0%20Project%20Templates/15%20Multi-Channel%20Application/30%20Mobile%20Project.md '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#Multi-Channel_Application/Mobile_Project') project of the [Multi-Channel Application](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/0%20Project%20Templates/15%20Multi-Channel%20Application '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#Multi-Channel_Application') template.
