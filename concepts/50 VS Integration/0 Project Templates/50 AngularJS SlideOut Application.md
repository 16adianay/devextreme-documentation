**AngularJS SlideOut Application** is a project template for building an HTML/JS application based on the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) framework and [DevExtreme widgets](/concepts/Common/05%20Introduction%20to%20DevExtreme/10%20Mobile%20Development/10%20Overview/30%20UI%20Widgets%20Library.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Introduction_to_DevExtreme/#Mobile_Development/Overview/UI_Widgets_Library'). In this project template, the [SlideOut](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxSlideOut '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxSlideOut/') widget is used as a global navigation control.

This application structure is detailed in the [AngularJS Approach](/concepts/10%20UI%20Widgets/0%20Basics/30%20Application%20Templates/1%20Mobile%20Application/2%20Angular%20Approach.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Basics/Application_Templates/#Mobile_Application/Angular_Approach') topic of the [Application Templates](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Basics/Application_Templates/#Application_Templates) article.

Generally, the basic project template is the minimum requirement for starting to build an application. You can then extend the project as required.

The application created using the **AngularJS SlideOut Application** template can be built for desktop or packaged for iOS, Android, WinPhone and PhoneGap. For details, refer to the [Packaging Tools](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/3%20Packaging%20Tools '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Packaging_Tools/') documentation section.
