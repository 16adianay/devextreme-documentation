The **Basic Application** project has a basic structure that is common for applications based on the DevExtreme framework. This application structure is detailed in the [Application Project](/concepts/40%20SPA%20Framework/01%20Application%20Project '/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Application_Project/') article.

The *.dxView* files are the HTML files that can be opened using the **View Designer**. To learn more about the View Designer, refer to the [Design-Time Features](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/1%20Design-Time%20Features '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Design-Time_Features/') documentation section.

The *app.config.js* file includes the configuration object used to initialize the [application object](/concepts/40%20SPA%20Framework/01%20Application%20Project/3%20Application%20Object.md '/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Application_Project/#Application_Object'). 

Generally, the basic project template is the minimum requirement for starting to build an application. You can then extend the project as required.

The application created using the **Basic Application** template can be built for the desktop or packaged for iOS, Android, WinPhone and PhoneGap. For details, refer to the [Packaging Tools](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/3%20Packaging%20Tools '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Packaging_Tools/') documentation section.
