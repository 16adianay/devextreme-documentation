**Basic Application (Type Script)** is the same as the [Basic Application](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/0%20Project%20Templates/1%20Basic%20Application.md '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#Basic_Application') project. The only difference is that the TypeScript language is used in the Basic Application (Type Script) and the required Type Script libraries are referenced in it.
