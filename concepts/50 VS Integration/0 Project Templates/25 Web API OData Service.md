To create a Web API OData Service, use the appropriate template provided by DevExtreme. When choosing the **DevExtreme Web API OData Service** template in the **New Project** dialog, a standard [Entity Data Model Wizard](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399247(v=vs.110).aspx) runs. The project that is generated by this wizard is extended by CORS and JSONP support.

After you are finished with the OData service project, add a DevExtreme project to the solution using the [Basic Application](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/0%20Project%20Templates/1%20Basic%20Application.md '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#Basic_Application') or [Multi-Channel Application](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/0%20Project%20Templates/15%20Multi-Channel%20Application '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#Multi-Channel_Application') template. In the DevExtreme Project Wizard, you will be able to choose the OData service from the current solution and generate views for the entities exposed by this service.
