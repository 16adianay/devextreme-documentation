This project is created when you choose **Mobile** in the DevExtreme Project Wizard and is intended to create an application for mobile devices. For this purpose, it includes [predefined layouts](/concepts/40%20SPA%20Framework/13%20Built-in%20Layouts '/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Built-in_Layouts/') that are designed for *Android*, *iOS* and *Win8Phone* platforms, along with style sheets that are required for different mobile devices to give an application its native looks. You can define different views for different platforms and device forms. To learn how to do this, refer to the [Views and Layouts](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Views_and_Layouts/#Device_Specific_Markup) article.

The application created using the **Mobile** project can be packaged for iOS, Android, Win8Phone and PhoneGap. To learn how to do this, refer to the [Packaging Tools](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/3%20Packaging%20Tools '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Packaging_Tools/') section.
