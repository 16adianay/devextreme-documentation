This project is created when you choose **Web** in the DevExtreme Project Wizard and is intended to create an application for a desktop. For this purpose, it includes the [Desktop](/concepts/40%20SPA%20Framework/13%20Built-in%20Layouts/53%20Desktop%20Layout.md '/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Built-in_Layouts/#Desktop_Layout') built-in layout (see the **Layouts** folder), a generic **light**/**dark** [predefined theme](/concepts/60%20Themes/10%20Predefined%20Themes '/Documentation/Guide/Themes/Predefined_Themes/') (see the **css** folder) and has a "webSite" [application mode](/api-reference/40%20SPA%20Framework/HtmlApplication/1%20Configuration/mode.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/HtmlApplication/Configuration/#mode').

Generally, the Desktop project has the same structure as the [basic project template](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/0%20Project%20Templates/1%20Basic%20Application.md '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#Basic_Application'). In addition, it references the **Shared** project, so the files (e.g., Views) from the **Shared** project are copied to the **Desktop** project. If the same files are found, the files from the **Desktop** project overwrite the files from the **Shared** project.

[note]In the **Desktop** project, a configuration object for the [application object](/concepts/40%20SPA%20Framework/01%20Application%20Project/3%20Application%20Object.md '/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Application_Project/#Application_Object') gets values for some options from the *app.config.js* file. Do not change this behavior, because the information contained in the *app.config.js* file is used when a view is displayed in the [View Designer](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/1%20Design-Time%20Features '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Design-Time_Features/').
