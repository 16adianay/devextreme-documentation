To [implement a view in a DevExtreme SPA Framework-based application](/concepts/40%20SPA%20Framework/1%20Views%20and%20Layouts/1%20Define%20a%20View.md '/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Views_and_Layouts/#Define_a_View'), define the view's HTML markup, apply style sheets and implement a function that returns the view's ViewModel. DevExtreme comes with the **View Designer** that helps you design view markup easily and quickly. To open the **View Designer**, change the View's *.html* file extension to the *.dxView* extension and double-click the file.

[note]If you create an application using [DevExtreme project templates](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/0%20Project%20Templates '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/'), HTML view files will already have the *.dxView* extension.

As you can see in the image above, the View Designer has Design and Source Views. The HTML code that is presented in the Source View is running in the Design View.

[note]To see a view from the [Shared project](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/0%20Project%20Templates/15%20Multi-Channel%20Application/10%20Shared%20Project.md '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#Multi-Channel_Application/Shared_Project') in the simulator of the Design View, select another project to show the view in its context. For this purpose, use a corresponding combobox in the [Device Settings Toolbar](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/1%20Design-Time%20Features/2%20Set%20Device%20Settings.md '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Design-Time_Features/#Set_Device_Settings').
