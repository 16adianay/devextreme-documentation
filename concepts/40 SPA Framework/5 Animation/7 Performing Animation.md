In DevExtreme applications, the [TransitionExecutor](/api-reference/50%20Common/utils/TransitionExecutor '/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Utils/TransitionExecutor/') object is used to perform animation. This object is designed so that it can perform several animations simultaneously or in a staggered manner, applying the animation presets that are registered for the [device](/api-reference/50%20Common/Object%20Structures/device '/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Object_Structures/device/') on which the current application is currently running.
