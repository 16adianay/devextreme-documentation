Since a WinJS application is ordinarily created using Visual Studio, the instructions given below are applicable for those who have the [DevExtreme Complete](/concepts/Common/07%20DevExtreme%20Packages/30%20DevExtreme%20Complete.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_Packages/#DevExtreme_Complete') package.

To deploy an application built using the DevExtreme SPA framework as a WinJS app, use the [Multi-Channel Application](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/0%20Project%20Templates/15%20Multi-Channel%20Application '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#Multi-Channel_Application') project template and choose **Win 8** as a target platform in the DevExtreme Project Wizard. The solution created using this template will include the [Shared](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/0%20Project%20Templates/15%20Multi-Channel%20Application/10%20Shared%20Project.md '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#Multi-Channel_Application/Shared_Project') project for developing a DevExtreme application and the [Win8](/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#VS_Integration_Project_Templates_Multi-Channel_Application_Win8_Project) project for deploying the DevExtreme application as a WinJS app. You can use standard deployment procedures provided for the Win8 project in Visual Studio. Since the Shared project is [linked](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/4%20Linking%20DevExtreme%20Projects '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Linking_DevExtreme_Projects/') to the Win8 project, the resulting application will be the DevExtreme application deployed as a WinJS app.

If you do not use the **Multi-Channel Application** application template, but have a [DevExtreme application project](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/0%20Project%20Templates/02%20DevExtreme%20App%20Project%20Template '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#DevExtreme_App_Project_Template') designed in Visual Studio, you can still deploy it as a WinJS app. For this purpose, add a standard Win8 project to your solution and link the DevExtreme project to the Win8 project. For details, refer to the [Linking to a Win8 Project](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/4%20Linking%20DevExtreme%20Projects/10%20Linking%20to%20Other%20Projects/20%20Linking%20to%20a%20Win8%20Project.md '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Linking_DevExtreme_Projects/#Linking_to_Other_Projects/Linking_to_a_Win8_Project') article.
