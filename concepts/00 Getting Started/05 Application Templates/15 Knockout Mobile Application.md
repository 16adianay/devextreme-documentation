[note]This article describes an application template for IDEs other than Visual Studio. Templates for Visual Studio are described in the **VS Integration** | [Project Templates](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/0%20Project%20Templates '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/') section.

The [Knockout](https://knockoutjs.com) library provides data binding facilities, but you still need a framework to manage the view navigation and rendering. In Knockout-based mobile applications, our own DevExtreme SPA Framework takes over these duties.

The DevExtreme SPA Framework is a rather broad topic. That is the reason why a [whole section of our documentation](/concepts/40%20SPA%20Framework '/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/') is dedicated to it. If you are after the information on the Knockout application template particularly, see the **SPA Framework** | [Application Project](/concepts/40%20SPA%20Framework/01%20Application%20Project '/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Application_Project/') article.
