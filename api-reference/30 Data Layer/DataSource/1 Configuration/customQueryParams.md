##### shortDescription
The bag of custom parameters passed to the query executed when the DataSource load operation is invoked.

You can use this option to pass additional parameters to OData service operations. Refer to the [Data Layer](/concepts/30%20Data%20Layer/51%20Data%20Source%20Examples/2%20OData/5%20Invoking%20Service%20Operations.md '/Documentation/Guide/Data_Layer/Data_Source_Examples/#OData/Invoking_Service_Operations') guide for more information.

[note]This option makes sense only if the current DataSource instance is associated with an ODataStore.
