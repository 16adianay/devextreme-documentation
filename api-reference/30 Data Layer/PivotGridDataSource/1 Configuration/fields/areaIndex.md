##### shortDescription
Index among the other fields displayed within the same area.

You can change the field order within an area by using this option. By default, the field order in the pivot grid is similar to the fields order in the [fields](/api-reference/30%20Data%20Layer/PivotGridDataSource/1%20Configuration/fields '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/PivotGridDataSource/Configuration/fields/') array.

[note] The order of fields affects the hierarchy structure in the header of the pivot grid. This option should not be confused with the sorting concept.
