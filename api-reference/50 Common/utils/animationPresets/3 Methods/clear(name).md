[note]If you need to have [predefined animations](/api-reference/50%20Common/utils/animationPresets '/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Utils/animationPresets/') in the repository and delete only custom animations, call the [resetToDefaults()](/api-reference/50%20Common/utils/animationPresets/3%20Methods/resetToDefaults().md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Utils/animationPresets/Methods/#resetToDefaults') method instead.
