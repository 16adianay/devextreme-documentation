##### shortDescription
Occurs in drop-down lists when the **onCustomItemCreating** function does not return any value.

---
Check that the function returns a Promise ([jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/Types/#Promise) or [native](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)) that is resolved after a custom item is created.
