Depending on the [layout](/Documentation/17_2/Guide/SPA_Framework/Built-in_Layouts/) used for the current view, specific [command containers](/api-reference/40%20SPA%20Framework/Markup%20Components/dxCommandContainer '/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/Markup_Components/dxCommandContainer/') will be available for commands added to this view. Depending on how you define [command mapping](/api-reference/40%20SPA%20Framework/HtmlApplication/1%20Configuration/commandMapping.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/HtmlApplication/Configuration/#commandMapping'), the command will be displayed by a specific item of the widget that serves as a command container. When clicking the widget item, the **execute()** method will be be called for the associated command. This method performs the function assigned to the [onExecute](/api-reference/40%20SPA%20Framework/Markup%20Components/dxCommand/1%20Configuration/onExecute.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/Markup_Components/dxCommand/Configuration/#onExecute') command option or calls the [navigate()](/api-reference/40%20SPA%20Framework/HtmlApplication/3%20Methods/navigate(uri_options).md '/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/HtmlApplication/Methods/#navigateuri_options') function to navigate to the URL specified for the **onExecute** command option.
