The identifier of the command.

Setting this option is mandatory, since a command identifier is required when defining an application's [command mapping](/api-reference/40%20SPA%20Framework/HtmlApplication/1%20Configuration/commandMapping.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/HtmlApplication/Configuration/#commandMapping'). The identifier should be unique throughout the entire application.
