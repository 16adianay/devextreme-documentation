##### shortDescription
Specifies the storage to be used by the application's [state manager](/api-reference/40%20SPA%20Framework/StateManager '/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/StateManager/') to store the application state.

---
By default, the state manager that is assigned to the **HtmlApplication** object works with the [session storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_storage#Local_and_session_storage). To specify another storage for application state storing, use the **stateStorage** option of the **HtmlApplication** object.
