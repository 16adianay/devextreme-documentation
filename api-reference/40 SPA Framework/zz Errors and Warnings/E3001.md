##### shortDescription
Occurs when the application's [router](/api-reference/40%20SPA%20Framework/HtmlApplication/2%20Fields/router.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/HtmlApplication/Fields/#router') cannot parse the URI to which the application navigates.

---
You can see the URI to which the application navigates in the browser's address bar. Check whether the URI is correct. If yes, check to which [routing rules](/concepts/40%20SPA%20Framework/3%20Navigation%20and%20Routing/1%20Declare%20a%20Routing.md '/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Navigation_and_Routing/#Declare_a_Routing') this URL must conform. If it conforms to none of the rules, add/change the rules or change the URI.

[note]Run the application in a browser without the [DevExtreme Simulator](/concepts/50%20VS%20Integration/2%20Simulation%20Tools/1%20Use%20Simulator.md '/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Simulation_Tools/#Use_Simulator') to see the current URI.
