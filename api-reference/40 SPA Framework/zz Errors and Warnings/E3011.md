##### shortDescription
Occurs when an appropriate controller is not found for the current context within the application's [registered controllers](/api-reference/40%20SPA%20Framework/HtmlApplication/1%20Configuration/layoutSet.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/HtmlApplication/Configuration/#layoutSet').

---
To investigate the problem, take a look at the JSON object that is provided in the browser's console. This object defines the current context and the registered controllers that are appropriate in the current context. In addition, check to make sure that a file with the required controller is referenced in the application.
