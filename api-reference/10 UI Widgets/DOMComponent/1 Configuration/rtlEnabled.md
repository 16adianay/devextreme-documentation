##### shortDescription
Specifies whether or not the current component supports a right-to-left representation.

---
If you need to switch the display of this DevExtreme component to right-to-left, enable a specifically designed configuration option - **rtlEnabled**. When this option is set to *true*, the text flows from right to left, and the layout the component's elements is reversed. To switch the entire application/site to a right-to-left representation, use the static [DevExpress.rtlEnabled](/api-reference/50%20Common/utils/rtlEnabled.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Utils/#rtlEnabled') field.
