##### shortDescription
A function that is executed only once, after the widget is initialized.

---
You cannot access widget elements in this function because it is executed before they are ready. Use the [onContentReady](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/Widget/1%20Configuration/onContentReady.md '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/#onContentReady') function instead.
