##### shortDescription
A handler for the **initialized** event. Executed only once, after the widget is initialized.

---
You cannot access widget elements in this handler because it is executed before they are ready. Use the [onContentReady](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/Widget/1%20Configuration/onContentReady.md '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/#onContentReady') handler instead.
