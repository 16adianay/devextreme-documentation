##### deprecated
This option is deprecated, because the functionality controlled by it was not supposed to belong to the **Lookup** widget. Instead, we suggest that you use the [SelectBox](/concepts/05%20Widgets/SelectBox/00%20Overview.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/SelectBox/Overview/') widget with the [acceptCustomValue](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxSelectBox/1%20Configuration/acceptCustomValue.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxSelectBox/Configuration/#acceptCustomValue') option set to **true**.
