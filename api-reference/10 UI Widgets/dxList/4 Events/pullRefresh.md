Instead, you can use the [onPullRefresh](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxList/1%20Configuration/onPullRefresh.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxList/Configuration/#onPullRefresh') option to handle the event.

[note]The "pull down to refresh" gesture is not supported by desktop browsers and Windows Phone devices. You can use it only in [mobile themes](/concepts/60%20Themes/10%20Predefined%20Themes '/Documentation/Guide/Themes/Predefined_Themes/') except the Windows Phone theme.
