This option makes sense only if the [selectionMode](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxMenuBase/1%20Configuration/selectionMode.md '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/#selectionMode') option is set to *'single'* and the [selectByClick](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxMenuBase/1%20Configuration/selectByClick.md '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/#selectByClick') option is set to **true**.

Assign a function to perform a custom action after a collection item is selected or unselected.
