##### shortDescription
Specifies the layout of items in the [row header](/concepts/10%20UI%20Widgets/71%20Pivot%20Grid/010%20Visual%20Elements/02%20Headers.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Pivot_Grid/Visual_Elements/#Headers').

Frequently, items in the row header have a hierarchical structure. By default, these items are arranged in a line occupying a significant amount of space. If the area assigned to **PivotGrid** is limited, use a more compact tree layout. The image below illustrates the difference between standard and tree layouts.
