If a field providing key values is not specified in the data source, the whole data object is considered the key. In this case, all arrays passed to this handler contain data objects instead of keys.

Call the [byKey(key)](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/GridBase/3%20Methods/byKey(key).md '{basewidgetpath}/Methods/#byKeykey') method to retrieve data.
