##### shortDescription
Specifies whether or not the widget automatically adjusts **center** and **zoom** option values when adding a new marker or route, or when creating a widget if it initially contains markers or routes.

---
Note that the zoom level can only be decreased to display all markers and routes. If the current zoom level and center position allow all routes and markers to be displayed on the map, they remain unchanged.
