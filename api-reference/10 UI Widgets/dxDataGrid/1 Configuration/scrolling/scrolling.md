##### shortDescription
A configuration object specifying [scrolling](/concepts/05%20Widgets/DataGrid/015%20Data%20Navigation/30%20Scrolling/010%20Scrolling.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Data_Navigation/#Scrolling') options.

The **DataGrid** widget supplies a user with an opportunity to scroll grid records. Scrolling can be performed within one page when used in conjunction with the [pager](/concepts/05%20Widgets/DataGrid/001%20Visual%20Elements/050%20Pager.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Visual_Elements/#Pager') or throughout the whole data source. In the latter case, data is still loaded by pages but a user moves through them continuously without noticing it. To specify required scrolling behavior, use the [mode](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/scrolling/mode.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/scrolling/#mode') property of the **scrolling** configuration object.
