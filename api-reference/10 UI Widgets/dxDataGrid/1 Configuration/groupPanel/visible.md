##### shortDescription
Specifies whether the [group panel](/concepts/10%20UI%20Widgets/70%20Data%20Grid/001%20Visual%20Elements/090%20Group%20Panel.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Data_Grid/Visual_Elements/#Group_Panel') is visible or not.

---
The group panel is hidden by default. To make it visible, assign *true* to **groupPanel** | **visible** option. Additionally, the group panel includes the *"auto"* mode, in which the visibility of the group panel relies on the device's screen size. On small-screen devices, the group panel will be hidden; on the others - shown.
