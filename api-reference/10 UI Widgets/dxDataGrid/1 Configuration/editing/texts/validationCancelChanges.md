##### shortDescription
Specifies text for a hint that appears when a user hovers the mouse pointer over the *"Cancel changes"* button. Setting this option makes sense only when the [mode](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/editing/mode.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/editing/#mode') option is set to *cell* and the [validation](/concepts/10%20UI%20Widgets/80%20Common/20%20Validation '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Common/Validation/') capabilities are enabled.
