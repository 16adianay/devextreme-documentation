A cancel button appears when a user is editing a grid record in the *"row"* [edit mode](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/editing/mode.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/editing/#mode'). It is located in the rightmost grid column along with the save button.
