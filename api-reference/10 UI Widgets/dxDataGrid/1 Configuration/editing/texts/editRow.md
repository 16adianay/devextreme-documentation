##### shortDescription
Specifies text for a button that turns a row into the editing state. Setting this option makes sense only when the [allowUpdating](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/editing/allowUpdating.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/editing/#allowUpdating') option is set to *true*.

An edit button accompanies each grid record if the [edit mode](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/editing/mode.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/editing/#mode') is *'row'*. This button is located in the rightmost grid column. You can specify text for this button using the **editRow** option.
