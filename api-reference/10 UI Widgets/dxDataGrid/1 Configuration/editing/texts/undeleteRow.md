##### shortDescription
Specifies text for a button that recovers a deleted row. Setting this option makes sense only if the grid uses the batch [edit mode](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/editing/mode.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/editing/#mode') and the [allowDeleting](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/editing/allowDeleting.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/editing/#allowDeleting') option is set to *true*.

In the batch mode, deleted rows can be restored by a click on the undelete button. You can specify text for this button using the **undeleteRow** option.
