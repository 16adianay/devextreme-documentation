##### shortDescription
Specifies whether or not grid rows must be shaded in a different way.

---
By default, all grid rows are displayed on a monochrome area without visual distinctions between them. If you need to distinguish one row from its neighboring rows visually, set the **rowAlternationEnabled** option to *true*. In this case, ordinary-looking rows will alternate with slightly shaded ones.
