##### shortDescription
Specifies the event on which a group will be expanded/collapsed.

---
By default, to expand/collapse a group, the user clicks its expand/collapse button. On small-screen devices, this approach may impair the user experience. As an alternative, consider expanding/collapsing a group by a click on the group row. For this purpose, assign *"rowClick"* to the **grouping** | **expandMode** option.
