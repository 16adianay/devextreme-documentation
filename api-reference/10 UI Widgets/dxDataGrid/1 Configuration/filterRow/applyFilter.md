##### shortDescription
Specifies when to apply a filter.

---
By default, a filter applies automatically when a user finishes typing a string in a filter row cell. Alternatively, you can give a user the opportunity to apply a filter at a required time. To do this, assign *'onClick'* to the **applyFilter** option. In this case, a filter will be applied by a click on the *"Apply Filter"* button.
