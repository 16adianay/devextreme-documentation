##### shortDescription
Specifies text for the operation of clearing the applied filter when a select box is used.

---
When a column holds boolean values or uses [lookup](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/columns/lookup '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/columns/lookup/'), a select box is used to filter grid records. Selecting an item in this select box filters grid records by this item. To clear the selection, a user must select the *"All"* item in the select box. You can specify a custom text for this item using the **showAllText** option.
