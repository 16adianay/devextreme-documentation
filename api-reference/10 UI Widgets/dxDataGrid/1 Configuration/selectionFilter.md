Specifies [filters](/concepts/30%20Data%20Layer/5%20Data%20Layer/2%20Reading%20Data/15%20Filtering '/Documentation/Guide/Data_Layer/Data_Layer/#Reading_Data/Filtering') for the records that must appear initially selected.

---
[note]This option applies only if selection is [deferred](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/selection/deferred.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/selection/#deferred').

This option also allows you to obtain [filter expressions](/concepts/30%20Data%20Layer/5%20Data%20Layer/2%20Reading%20Data/15%20Filtering '/Documentation/Guide/Data_Layer/Data_Layer/#Reading_Data/Filtering') for the currently selected rows. Note that if all records are selected, the **selectionFilter** value is *null*. If there are no selected records, the value contains an empty array.

In addition, you can obtain the selected row keys or data objects. For further information, see the [getSelectedRowKeys()](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/3%20Methods/getSelectedRowKeys().md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Methods/#getSelectedRowKeys') and [getSelectedRowsData()](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/3%20Methods/getSelectedRowsData().md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Methods/#getSelectedRowsData') method descriptions.
