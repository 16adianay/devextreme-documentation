##### shortDescription
Enables a hint that appears when a user hovers the mouse pointer over a cell with truncated content.

---
The cell's content may be truncated if the [width](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/columns/width.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/columns/#width') of the cell's column becomes very small. In this case, when a user hovers the mouse pointer over such a cell, a hint containing the cell's value appears. To disable cell hints, assign *false* to the **cellHintEnabled** option.
