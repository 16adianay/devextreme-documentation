##### shortDescription
Specifies whether or not a column can be hidden by a user. Setting this option makes sense only when the [column chooser](/concepts/05%20Widgets/DataGrid/001%20Visual%20Elements/120%20Column%20Chooser.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Visual_Elements/#Column_Chooser') is visible.

---
If the **allowHiding** option is set to *true* for a column, a user can drag this column by its header onto the column chooser panel to hide it. If this option is set to *false*, the column cannot be hidden by a user.

To learn more about how to invoke the column chooser, as well as the options available, refer to the [columnChooser](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/columnChooser '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/columnChooser/') object description.
