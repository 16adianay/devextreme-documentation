##### shortDescription
Specifies if a column can be used for searching grid records. Setting this option makes sense only when the [search panel](/concepts/10%20UI%20Widgets/70%20Data%20Grid/001%20Visual%20Elements/080%20Search%20Panel.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Data_Grid/Visual_Elements/#Search_Panel') is visible.

---
By default, searching is performed in all columns. But you can disable it in certain columns. For this purpose, set the [allowSearch](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/columns/allowSearch.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/columns/#allowSearch') option to *false*.
