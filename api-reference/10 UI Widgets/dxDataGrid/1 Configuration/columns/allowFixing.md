##### shortDescription
Specifies whether or not the column can be anchored to a grid edge by end users. Setting this option makes sense only when the [columnFixing](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/columnFixing '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/columnFixing/') | **enabled** option is set to *true*.

---
If the **allowFixing** option is set to *true* for a column, the fixing-related commands in the column's context menu are available. To hide these commands from the context menu, set the column's **allowFixing** option to *false*.

For details on fixed columns, refer to the [Fixing Grid Columns](/concepts/05%20Widgets/DataGrid/001%20Visual%20Elements/010%20Grid%20Columns/060%20Fixing%20Grid%20Columns.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Visual_Elements/#Grid_Columns/Fixing_Grid_Columns') topic.
