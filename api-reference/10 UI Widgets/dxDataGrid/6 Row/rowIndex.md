The *visible* index of the row.

When you have several pages in a grid, grid rows are indexed beginning with 0 on each page. Note that [group rows](/concepts/10%20UI%20Widgets/70%20Data%20Grid/001%20Visual%20Elements/100%20Group%20Rows '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Data_Grid/Visual_Elements/#Group_Rows') are counted as well and, thus, have row indexes. For further information about row indexes, see the [Grid Rows](/concepts/10%20UI%20Widgets/70%20Data%20Grid/001%20Visual%20Elements/020%20Grid%20Rows.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Data_Grid/Visual_Elements/#Grid_Rows') topic.
