Deselects specific grid records.

##### param(keys): array
The keys of the records to be deselected.

---
To access a grid record by a key, a field providing key values must be specified in a [data source](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/dataSource.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#dataSource'). If no key was specified, the whole data object is considered the key.

Alternatively, you can deselect all grid records at once using the [clearSelection()](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/3%20Methods/clearSelection().md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Methods/#clearSelection') method.
