##### shortDescription
This article describes configuration options of a simple form item.

---
A simple form item is an editor-label pair usually bound to a [formData](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxForm/1%20Configuration/formData.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Configuration/#formData') object field used to display and modify this field.

You can also create a simple item without binding it to a **formData** field. For example, it can be a check box that allows a user to confirm his agreement to process entered data.

For detailed information on creating simple items, see the [Create Simple Items](/concepts/10%20UI%20Widgets/20%20UI%20Widgets%20-%20Deep%20Dive/dxForm/4%20Define%20Items%20Manually/0%20Create%20Simple%20Items.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/UI_Widgets_-_Deep_Dive/dxForm/#Define_Items_Manually/Create_Simple_Items') topic.
