##### shortDescription
Specifies whether or not item labels in all groups are aligned.

---
[note]This option applies only to those simple items that are nested within a [group item](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxForm/6%20Group%20Item '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Group_Item/'). Thus, we recommend that you _do not_ leave any simple items ungrouped if you need a consistent alignment throughout the **Form**.
