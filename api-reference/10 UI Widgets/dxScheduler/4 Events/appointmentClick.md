Instead, you can use the [onAppointmentClick](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxScheduler/1%20Configuration/onAppointmentClick.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxScheduler/Configuration/#onAppointmentClick') option to handle the event.

In case of recurring appointments or appointments with multiple resources, you may want to obtain information about the currently selected appointment, not the initial appointment. For this purpose, use the **targetedAppointmentData** field of the function parameter. Otherwise, use the **appointmentData** field.
