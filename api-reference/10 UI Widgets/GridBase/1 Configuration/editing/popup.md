##### shortDescription
Configures the popup. Used only if **editing**.[mode](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/GridBase/1%20Configuration/editing/mode.md '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/editing/#mode') is *"popup"*.

---
The popup always contains a form, whose items are used for editing. The **popup** object contains options that customize the popup itself (see their list in the [Popup Configuration](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxPopup/1%20Configuration '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPopup/Configuration/') section). To customize the form items, use the [form](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/GridBase/1%20Configuration/editing/form.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/editing/#form') option.
