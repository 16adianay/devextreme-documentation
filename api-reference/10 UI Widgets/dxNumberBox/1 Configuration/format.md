[note] If you set this option, the telephone keyboard will be used for editing on mobile devices. It may lack the point, comma, and other symbols useful when entering decimals. Set the [mode](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxNumberBox/1%20Configuration/mode.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxNumberBox/Configuration/#mode') option to *"text"* to use the standard keyboard instead.
