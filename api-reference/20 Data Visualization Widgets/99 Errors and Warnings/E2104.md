Occurs if the **logarithmBase** option of **Chart** or **RangeSelector** was set to an invalid value.

---
This error may occur if you have set the **logarithmBase** option of a logarithmic [axis](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/10%20dxChart/1%20Configuration/argumentAxis/logarithmBase.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/argumentAxis/#logarithmBase') (for **Chart**) or a logarithmic [scale](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/25%20dxRangeSelector/1%20Configuration/scale/logarithmBase.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/scale/#logarithmBase') (for **RangeSelector**) incorrectly. The value assigned to this option must be an integer number greater than 1.
