[note]DevExtreme widgets provide a wide choice of [predefined formats](/api-reference/50%20Common/Object%20Structures/format/type.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Object_Structures/format/#type'). If you are, however, going to use custom formats, link the [Globalize](https://github.com/jquery/globalize) library to your project. Learn how to do this from the [Installation](/concepts/20%20Data%20Visualization/05%20Basics/01%20Installation '/Documentation/Guide/Data_Visualization/Basics/Installation/') topic.
