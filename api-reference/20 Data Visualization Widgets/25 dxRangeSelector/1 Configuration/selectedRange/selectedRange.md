##### shortDescription
Specifies the range to be selected when displaying the **RangeSelector**.

---
The selected range is the entire scale by default. To set the required range to be selected after the **RangeSelector** widget is displayed on a page, set the **startValue** and **endValue** properties for the **selectedRange** configuration object.

You can write a callback function to react to a change in the selected range. Assign this function to the [onSelectedRangeChanged](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/25%20dxRangeSelector/1%20Configuration/onSelectedRangeChanged.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/#onSelectedRangeChanged') option.
