##### shortDescription
Range selector's indent options.

The indent is used to precisely align scales of several widgets arranged vertically. This is the distance between the container edge and the range selector's scale (see the image below).

Note that if the indent is set very small, the [Scale Labels](/concepts/20%20Data%20Visualization/30%20RangeSelector/10%20RangeSelector%20Elements/10%20Scale/40%20Scale%20Labels.md '/Documentation/Guide/Data_Visualization/RangeSelector/RangeSelector_Elements/#Scale/Scale_Labels') will be cut.
