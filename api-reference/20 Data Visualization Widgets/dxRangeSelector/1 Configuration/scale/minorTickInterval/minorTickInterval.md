##### shortDescription
Specifies an interval between minor ticks.

---
In the case of a numeric scale, assign a numeric value to this property. If the scale is of the date-time type, assign one of the predefined string values. To set an interval to several days, hours, etc., assign an object with the corresponding field specified (**days**, **hours** or another field). Note that this object should contain only one of the fields described in this section.

[note]Minor ticks are unavailable for a discrete and semi-discrete scale.

When the [snapToTicks](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxRangeSelector/1%20Configuration/behavior/snapToTicks.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/behavior/#snapToTicks') property is set to **true**, sliders are docked to both major and minor ticks.

To prohibit the display of minor ticks, set the scale's **showMinorTicks** property to **false**.

To set a custom tick interval between major ticks, use the scale's **tickInterval** property.

When using the widget as an [ASP.NET MVC Control](/concepts/35%20ASP.NET%20MVC%20Controls/20%20Fundamentals '/Documentation/Guide/ASP.NET_MVC_Controls/Fundamentals/'), specify this option using the `VizTimeInterval` enum. This enum accepts the same values, but they start with an upper-case letter, for example, *'day'* becomes `Day`.
