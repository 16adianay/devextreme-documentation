##### shortDescription
An object specifying options for the map areas.

---
The map areas usually represent geographical objects, such as countries, continents, etc. The appearance of these areas is specified by the options of the **areaSettings** configuration object. If these options are defined on the first level of the **areaSettings** object, they are applied to all the map areas at once. However, you can specify several of these options for certain areas exclusively. See the [customize](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxVectorMap/1%20Configuration/areaSettings/customize.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxVectorMap/Configuration/areaSettings/#customize') option description to learn how.
