When implementing a handling function, use the object passed to it as its parameter. Among the fields of this object, you can find the clicked series point. To learn about point members that you can use, refer to the description of the [Point](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxPieChart/7%20Chart%20Elements/Point '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPieChart/Chart_Elements/Point/') object. To get the [parent series](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxPieChart/7%20Chart%20Elements/Series '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPieChart/Chart_Elements/Series/') of the point, use the **target.series** field of the object passed to the handler as its parameter.
