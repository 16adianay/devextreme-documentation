When implementing a handling function, use the object passed to it as its parameter. Among the fields of this object, you can find the series whose selection state has been changed. To identify whether this series was selected or deselected, call its [isSelected()](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/BaseChart/7%20Chart%20Elements/Series/3%20Methods/isSelected().md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Chart_Elements/Series/Methods/#isSelected') method. To discover series fields and methods, refer to the [Series](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxChart/7%20Chart%20Elements/Series '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Chart_Elements/Series/') class description.
