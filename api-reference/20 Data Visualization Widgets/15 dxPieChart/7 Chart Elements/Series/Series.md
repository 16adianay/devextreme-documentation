##### shortDescription
This section describes the fields and methods that can be used in code to manipulate the **Series** object.

---
When you get a series as the return value of a function, or a callback function parameter, you can use the members of the **Series** object.

To get the required series, use the chart's function [getAllSeries()](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/15%20dxPieChart/3%20Methods/getAllSeries().md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPieChart/Methods/#getAllSeries').
