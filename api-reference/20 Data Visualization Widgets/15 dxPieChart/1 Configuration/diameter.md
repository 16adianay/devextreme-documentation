##### shortDescription
Specifies the diameter of the pie.

---
This option accepts a number that identifies the ratio between the pie's diameter and the container's width or height (depending on which of them is lesser). For example, assume that the widget's container is 300x500 pixels and the **diameter** option is set to 0.5. Then, the resulting diameter of the pie will be: 

*0.5 * min(300,500) = 0.5 * 300 = 150 pixels*
