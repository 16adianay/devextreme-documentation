---
When you visualize data using several value axes on a single [pane](/concepts/05%20Widgets/Chart/10%20Visual%20Elements/110%20Panes.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Chart/Visual_Elements/#Panes'), these axes must have different [names](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxChart/1%20Configuration/valueAxis/name.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/valueAxis/#name'). If they do not, the E2102 occurs.
