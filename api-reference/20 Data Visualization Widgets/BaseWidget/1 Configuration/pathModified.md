##### shortDescription
Notifies a widget that it is embedded into an HTML page that uses a path modifier.

---
If you place a widget on a page that uses a path modifier, notify the widget about it by setting the **pathModified** option to *true*. As an example of such modifiers, the [`<base>`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_base.asp) HTML tag can be considered. Also, we recommend you enable this option if you place the widget inside the [`<iframe>`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp) tag.
