##### shortDescription
Notifies the widget that it is embedded into an HTML page that uses a tag modifying the path.

---
If you place the widget on a page that uses a tag modifying the path ([`<base>`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_base.asp), [`<iframe>`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp), etc.), some of the widget elements may get mixed up or disappear. To solve this problem, set the **pathModified** option to *true*.
