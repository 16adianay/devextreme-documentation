##### shortDescription
Specifies the widget title.

---
Use this property to set the text to be displayed as the widget title. If you need to specify the title's position in the widget, assign an object to the **title** property with the required fields specified. In this instance, set the title's text using the [text](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/BaseWidget/1%20Configuration/title/text.md '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/title#text') property.

The widget can display additional text in the subtitle. It is placed under the title. Use properties of the [subtitle](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/BaseWidget/1%20Configuration/title/subtitle '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/title/subtitle') object to assign a text to the subtitle and change its font.
