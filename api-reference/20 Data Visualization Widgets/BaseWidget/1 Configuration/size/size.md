##### shortDescription
Specifies the size of the widget in pixels.

---
By default, the widget occupies the entire area of the parent container. If you need to set a particular size for the widget, different from the container's size, assign a height and width in pixels to **height** and **width** properties of the **size** object.

Using the **size** object, you can hide the widget. For this purpose, simply assign 0 to both the height and width of the widget.
