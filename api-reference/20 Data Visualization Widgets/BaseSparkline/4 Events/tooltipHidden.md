The sparkline's tooltip becomes invisible when a user moves the mouse cursor outside of the widget.

When a tooltip is made hidden, you can perform specific actions by handling this event. To do this, implement a handling function and assign it to the **onTooltipHidden** option. When implementing a handling function, use the object passed to it as its parameter. This object will provide you with the widget instance and its container.
