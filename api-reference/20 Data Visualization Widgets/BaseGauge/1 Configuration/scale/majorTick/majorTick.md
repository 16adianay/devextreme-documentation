##### shortDescription
Specifies options of the gauge's major ticks.

---
<p>Major ticks are calculated automatically based on the scale's <b>startValue</b> and <b>endValue</b> property values. They are visible by default. You can set a custom major tick interval or add custom major ticks using the <b>tickInterval</b> and <b>customTickValues</b> properties respectively. To specify the visibility of major ticks, use the <b>visible</b> and <b>showCalculatedTicks</b> properties. You can also specify the length, width and color of the major ticks using corresponding properties.</p>
