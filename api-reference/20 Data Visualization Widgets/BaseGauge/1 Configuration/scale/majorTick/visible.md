##### deprecated
Use the **tick** | **visible** option instead.

##### shortDescription
Indicates whether scale major ticks are visible or not.

---
<p>When this property is set to <i>false</i>, both the major ticks that are automatically calculated and the major ticks that are specifically set (see <b>customTickValues</b>) become invisible. To hide the automatically calculated minor ticks only, set the <b>showCalculatedTicks</b> property to <i>false</i>.</p>
