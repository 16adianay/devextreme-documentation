##### shortDescription
Indicates whether scale major ticks are visible or not.

When this property is set to **false**, both the major ticks that are automatically calculated and the major ticks that are specifically set (see **customTickValues**) become invisible. To hide the automatically calculated minor ticks only, set the **showCalculatedTicks** property to **false**.
