##### field(e.model): object
The model data. Available only if you use Knockout.

---
The indicator's tooltip becomes invisible when a user hovers the mouse cursor over another indicator or moves it outside the widget.

When a tooltip is made hidden, you can perform specific actions by handling this event. To do this, implement a handling function and assign it to the **onTooltipHidden** option. When implementing a handling function, use the object passed to it as its parameter. This object will provide you with the widget instance, its container and the object describing the hovered indicator. You can use its **index** field to get the index of the hovered **subvalue** indicator (the index of the main value indicator is **undefined**).
