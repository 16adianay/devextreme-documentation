##### shortDescription
Provides information about the state of the **point** object.

---
Each point within a chart can be in several states. These states are represented by the numbers that are enumerated in the list below:

- **0**   
The point is not hovered and not selected (normal state);
- **1**   
The point is hovered;
- **2**   
The point is selected;
- **3**   
The point is hovered and selected.

You can also use the **isHovered()** and **isSelected()** point methods to check whether a point is hovered or selected.

To learn more about the handling of point hover and point selection, refer to the [Point Hover](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Visualization/Charts/End-User_Interaction/#Charts_End-User_Interaction_Hover_Handling_Point_Hover) and [Point Selection](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Visualization/Charts/End-User_Interaction/#Charts_End-User_Interaction_Selection_Handling_Point_Selection) topics.
