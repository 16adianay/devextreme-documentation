The point's tooltip becomes invisible when a user hovers the mouse cursor over another series point. In addition, you can hide a tooltip in code, using the **hideTooltip()** method of the chart or point.

When a tooltip is made hidden, you can perform specific actions by handling the **tooltipHidden** event. When implementing a handling function, use the object passed to it as its parameter. Among the fields of this object, you can find the series point whose tooltip becomes hidden.
